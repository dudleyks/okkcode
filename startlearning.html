  <h2>So Coding...What is it?</h2>
  <p>Coding or computer programming is used by pretty much anything that uses a plug or battery. It is used to create websites, apps and so much more!</p>
  <br>
  <p>Codes are instructions a computer uses to help it understand the task it is being asked to perform</p>
  <br>
  <p>There are so many languages you can learn! Some examples are HTML, CSS, Javascript, C+, Ruby, Python and the list goes on and on! Each one does different weird and wonderful things!</p>

  <h2>Let's start with the basics shall we?</h2>

  <h2>Hypertext Markup Language or HTML for short</h2>
  <p>It is a language that is used to create the layout of a webpage and is the backbone for most of the pages you visit</p>
  <br>
  <p>Most HTML elements have an opening tag < > and a closing tag </ ></p>
  <p>The only difference between opening and closing tags is the forward slash after the opening chevron of a closing tag.</p>

  <h2>Headings</h2>
  <p>There are 6 different levels of headings and subheadings. The h1 element are the biggest and normally used for main headings. Then h2 elements may be used for a subheading. There are 6 different levels of headings and subheadings.
  You can create a h1 tag like this:</p>

  <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
  <p>To create a paragraph text on websites you can use p tags!
  You can create a paragraph tag like this:</p>

  <h2>Adding Images!</h2>
  <p>Every website needs images! You can include this using the img element and the scr attribute.
  Img is an abbreviation for image and scr is an abbreviation for source.</p>
  <br>
  <p>It is good practice to include an alt attribute. This text is used to improve accessibility and will be displayed if the image doesn’t load.</p>
  <br>
  <p>You can add an image like this:</p>
  <br>
  <p>Notice that the img elements are self-closing</p>

  <h2>Want to create lists?</h2>
  <p>Great news you can do this using the <ul> element for unordered lists and the <ol> element for ordered list.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Example for unordered list:</p>
  <br>
  <p>This would create a unordered (bullet point) list.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Example for ordered list:</p>
  <br>
  <p>This would create an ordered (numbered) list.
  P.s. You can do so much more with html, but we wanted to keep it very basic and simple.</p>

  <h2>And now let’s learn about Cascading Style Sheets or CSS</h2>
  <p>This is a style sheet language that is used to describe how HTML elements are presented. HTML provides the structure of the page whereas CSS provides the visual layout for the page.
  You may choose to change the colour</p>
  <br>
  <p>This is done by typing:</p>
  <br>
  <p>For all my non-American friends do keep in mind you have to spell colour the American way without the u otherwise it won’t work. Sad times I know :/</p>
  <br>
  <p>This will change the colour of heading one (the main heading) to violet and give it a white background.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Alternatively, you can use RGBA Value. Rgba (red,green,blue,alpha) alpha controls the opacity of a colour. Alpha is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):</p>
  <p>For example:</p>
  <br>
  <p>You can also change the font and the size</p>
  <p>This will change all the paragraphs on the page to the font veranda and font size will be 20.</p>

  <br>
  <p>So, this was a very basic taste of coding. Hopefully we didn’t scare you away!
  Now that you have had a taste of coding i.e HTML and CSS we have a few website suggestions where you can learn to code for free. Yes we said for FREE!! Just click on the images below. So... what are you waiting for?</p>
